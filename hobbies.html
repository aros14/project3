    <h3>Listening to music</h3>
    <p>This is quite literally my favorite thing to do in the whole wide world. I use Spotify because I am a sucker for the Spotify wrapped statistics! I listen to a lot of different
    kinds of music from all different periods of time. Naturally, it means I love going to concerts. My first concert was R5 when I was around 10 years old. I have gone to Justin 
    Bieber's, Selena Gomez's, Jonas Brothers', Conan Gray's, HAIM's, and Clairo's concert thus far.</p>

    <h3>Soccer</h3>
    <p>I started playing soccer when I was around 4 years old. It has been a big part of my life until I got to college, it is difficult to continue to play due to a lot of
    outstanding factors. I play just for fun now, and I continue to follow the sport in my everyday life. I was really sad about Mexico not making it past the round of 16, but   
    I blame the coach. I am <strong>very</strong> excited for the Women's World Cup this year, taking place in Australia. The USWNT is going to <em>kill</em> it.</p>

    <h3>Coloring</h3>
    <p>I love coloring when I get the chance. It is very relaxing for me and it helps me unwind. I recently got into it, and I started with markers from Five Below. I now have
    better markers and a couple different coloring books.</p>
