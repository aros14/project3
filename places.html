    <h3>Mexico</h3>
    <p> I was originally born in Mexico, so I have luckily been able to visit many times. My family lives in Guanajuato so we normally go around that area. My favorite area is 
    Queretaro, I was born there and for a short time grew up there. I have been to Cancun once because it was a special occasion, but I hope to get to go again. The following are 
    pictures from some of my trips.</p>

    <h3>Canada</h3>
    <p>I have been to Canada two or three times. I visited Quebec and Montreal, they were both really nice and it was very peaceful. They had better food than I thought, so the 
    bakeries were nice surprises. People really keep to themselves there. We did lots of walking, the scenery was beautiful so I didn't mind. I would like to visit Vancouver next.</p>

    <h3>Europe</h3>
    <p>One Thanksgiving break we went to Europe for a week. We visited Berlin and France, it was a bit cold but it didn't stop us from exploring as much as we could. I, personally,
    liked Berlin more than France. This might be a bit of a hot take, but I think Paris is overrated. I feel like Berlin is much richer and it has more to offer. Food was 
    a miss besides the drinks. I had the best hot wine in Berlin, it was perfect.</p>
